be a link to an in-development dashboard in your BI tool, or a query that
compares an existing model with a new one.

Use screenshots of queries and results that demonstrate the impact of your changes. 

Use the DataRecce.io toolkit to show how models have changed between dev and prod. Include ad-hoc queries, data profiling results, or schema and row count diffs where relevant.

such as notifying stakeholders.
As with validation of models, use screenshots and queries to illustrate the impact.

## Changes to existing models:
<!---
Include this section if you are changing any existing models. Link any related
pull requests on your BI tool, or instructions for merge (e.g. whether old
