# Data Team Intern Guide

**Goal**: This guide will help you through your internship step by step.

## Timeline

Your internship will last between **12 and 16 weeks**. You’ll work part-time (around 30-40 days) or full-time (60-80 days). 

- **Keep your Slack status updated** with the day you're on (based on 8-hour days). Example: If you work 4 hours today, it’s “Day 1.5.”

### Part-Time 12-Week Plan

- **Days 1-7**: Get familiar with GitLab and the Data Team, focusing on `dbt`.
- **Day 8**: Learn why documentation is important.
- **Days 9-10**: Check which `dbt` models don’t have documentation and make a list.
- **Day 11**: Understand why work processes, like testing, are important.
- **Days 12-13**: Spot gaps in process documentation and suggest improvements.
- **Days 14-16**: Shadow a data analyst and start thinking about your own project.
- **Day 17**: Learn about testing data quality and start working on your independent project.
- **Days 18-19**: Check which `dbt` models don’t have basic tests (like not-null/unique).
- **Days 20-22**: Shadow more and work on your project.
- **Days 23-27**: Do an analysis with supervision and continue your project.
- **Day 28**: Present your project to the team in a 40-minute talk, followed by Q&A. Write a blog post too!
- **Days 29-30**: Wrap up your internship and remove access to systems.
